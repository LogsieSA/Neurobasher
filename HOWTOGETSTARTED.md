# How to get started
As mentioned before, Neurobasher was designed to run on eWaste, so you will not need an i9 and DDR5. Look for old [Dell Optiplexes](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=Dell+optiplex) which boot, the cheapest ones available, bonus points if you can buy them in bulk.
Remember that the more nodes you have, the harder live performance will be. The complexity of your performance is only governed by your skill with Neurobasher.
You can also get old SFF PCs from schools, universities, libraries and businesses, only way to know is to give them a call, worst case you get a "No we don't, sorry".

# Picking a good switch
You do not necessarily require a switch which can act as the PTP master clock, all you need is one which supports it, even that is optional. Get an old switch like a [Cisco Catalyst 2960](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=cisco+catalyst+2960). It may have loud fans but it is cheap and a loud sound system can dwarf that noise.
