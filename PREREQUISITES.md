# Prerequisites for a basic set-up
1. Atleast 2 motherboards which boot.
2. A switch, preferrably a managed switch which can act as a PTP master, otherwise you will need to pick your best, most stable node to be the master clock which will work for testing purposes.
3. Ethernet cables for however many nodes you have, DO NOT USE WIFI!!!!
3. A physical mixer, the more channels, the more flexibility and scalability your synth will have.
4. A monitor.
5. A keyboard (I reccomend [PS/2 keyboards](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17696386))
6. A 3.5mm TRS jack(Aux) to whatever line input your mixer takes, normally 1/4" TRS jacks, for every node.
7. A grounded power strip. Other methods of grounding need testing, do let me know!



# Additional upgrades for a live setting
1. Extra nodes which can be used to replace the nodes which fail, think of it like a RAID array.
2. Extra ethernet cables.
3. A case which houses all of the nodes.
4. Diagnostic LEDs to show connection to master clock.
5. A MIDI keyboard for nodes which do not need to have ultra-tight synchronisation
