# BIOS Configuration for maximum stability

1. Disable C-States.
2. Disable Virtualization.
3. Enable peformance presets.
4. Disable any "Eco-friendly" or "Power saving" settings, if it sounds like it may cause the CPU to change speeds/voltage, disable it.
5. Make sure your CMOS batteries are new and hold enough voltage.
6. Do NOT undervolt/overclock anything, Neurobasher does not require much computing power, doing this might make the node less stable for close to 0 gain.
7. If your motherboard has any high quality audio settings, enable them.
8. Keep iGPU enabled, unless you want to use a GPU to load a black and white TTY.


Is this overkill? Yes, but so is the whole project.
