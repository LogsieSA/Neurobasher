# Usage
A blank node with everything installed and configured(except PTP), but no pre-packaged instruments. Remember to configure ptp.service using:

```
$ sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/ptp.service
```
Use this to find out how PTP works, by default I am using the software clock:

```
$ man ptp41
```
